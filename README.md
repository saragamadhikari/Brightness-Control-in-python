# Brightness-Control-in-python


This Python-based project allows for intuitive control of your PC's screen brightness through dynamic hand gestures. By utilizing computer vision algorithms, the system tracks the precise movements of your thumb and index finger. The relative distance between these fingers is mapped in real-time to adjust the brightness levels, offering a seamless and interactive user experience. This project exemplifies the integration of gesture recognition technology with practical system control, enhancing user interaction through natural gestures.

Thank you!!!!
